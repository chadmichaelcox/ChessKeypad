Problem
The following diagram is of a standard telephone keypad. It consists of a 4x3 grid of buttons. Using the valid moves of a 
piece from the game of chess, varying combinations of 7-digit phone numbers can be derived. For example, starting in the 
upper-right corner (the “3” key) using a rook (which moves any number of spaces horizontally or vertically), one valid 
number, after pressing the initial “3” key, is: 314-5289.
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
* 0 #
Write a program that will count the number of valid 7-digit phone numbers that can be traced out on the keypad for every
given chess piece. The following rules define a valid phone number:
• Seven digits in length
• Cannot start with a 0 or 1
• Cannot contain a * or #
Remember
• This is not a test on your knowledge of development libraries.
• Do not waste time stuck on any one area of functionality, just write a dummy function, and continue.
• Please try to make sure your code compiles and you can talk us through it all when your time is up.
• Please note some of this is deliberately vague to reflect real world scenarios and encourage you to seek answers
from myself or the team for clarity on what is required.
• Please feel free to ask as many questions as you like throughout the test as needed.
• Note that it is possible that some pieces may not have any valid phone numbers.
What we are looking for?
• The correct answers for each individual chess piece.
• Your solution is maintainable by someone who has not seen it.
• Object-oriented design concepts should be used where-ever they make sense.
• It should be easy to extend the program for new requirements;
o New keyboard layouts
o Different rules
o New types of chess pieces
Questions?
• How do you know what you have developed is correct?
• How can you make it more efficient?
